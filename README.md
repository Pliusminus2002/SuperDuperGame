SuperDuperGame 🎮

SuperDuperGame is a browser-based 3D game built with Three.js.
It was originally created as a personalized interactive experience for a friend and later refined into a technical portfolio project demonstrating real-time 3D development in the browser.

The project focuses on building a fully interactive 3D environment using WebGL through Three.js, handling 3D models, textures, lighting, and background audio while deploying and maintaining a live version online.

💡 Project Context

This was not a commercial or client-based project.
It began as a creative 3D web experience built specifically for a friend and evolved into a structured technical project.

The development process included:

Managing 3D assets in a browser environment

Handling file paths and case-sensitivity issues during deployment

Debugging real-world production problems

Deploying and maintaining a live WebGL application

Understanding performance considerations in browser-based 3D applications
